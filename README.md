# Section 0: Welcome to the Workshop!

## Welcome to the Workshop!

Welcome to the Petnica Ethereum Workshop Edition 2024! In this workshop, we will explore the fundamentals of Ethereum, including the basics of smart contracts and how they work. You‚Äôll gain practical insights into Ethereum‚Äôs core concepts and get hands-on experience by writing your first smart contracts.

## Best Practices

- **Follow along with me in live coding sessions**: Actively participate during the live coding sessions. This hands-on approach will help you understand the concepts better and clarify any doubts in real-time.
- **Ask whenever something is not clear**: If something‚Äôs confusing, just ask! No question is too basic, and it's better to get clarity right away.
- **Google it or ChatGPT it**: Stuck on something? Hit up Google or ask ChatGPT.

# Section 1: Ethereum Basics

## What is Ethereum?

- üìÑ [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)
  - üë§ [Vitalik Buterin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin)
- üåê The world computer
- üñ•Ô∏è State machine
- üîÑ Ethereum and Turing Completeness
- üí∞ Ether

## Ethereum Accounts

- **Address model**: Uses a 20-byte address for each account.
- **Two types of accounts**:
  - Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs): Controlled by private keys, like the MetaMask wallets installed by students. These accounts have no code.
  - Contract Accounts: Controlled by their contract code, activated upon receiving a message or transaction.
- **Account fields**:
  - Nonce: Counter to ensure each transaction is processed once.
  - Ether balance: Current balance of the account.
  - Contract code: If present, the code of the account.
  - Storage: Empty by default.

## What is smart contract?

- **Fundamental building blocks**: Essential component of Ethereum's application layer.
- **Term coined by Nick Szabo**:

  - 1994: Introduced the concept.
  - 1996: Explored potential uses.

- **Characteristics**:
  - **Immutable**: Once deployed, the code cannot change.
  - **Deterministic**: Execution outcome is consistent for everyone, given the same transaction context and blockchain state.

# Section 2: Your first smart contract

## Welcome to Remix
Hello world example, intro to bytecode, compilation, abi etc..
